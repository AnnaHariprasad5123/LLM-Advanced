### Python Basics

- **Syntax and semantics**: Understand Python's syntax and programming constructs (loops, conditionals, functions, classes).
- **Data structures**: Gain familiarity with Python's built-in data structures (lists, dictionaries, sets, tuples) for effective data manipulation and storage.
- **Environment and package management:** Learn to set up Python environments and manage packages using tools like pip and conda.

### Data Science Libraries

- **NumPy and Pandas:** Master these libraries for numerical and data manipulation tasks, respectively. NumPy provides support for arrays and matrices, while Pandas offers high-level data structures and operations for manipulating structured data.
- **Matplotlib and Seaborn**: Acquire the skills to visualize data using these libraries, which is crucial for data analysis and insight gathering.

### Data Preprocessing

- **Handling missing values:** Learn techniques for dealing with missing data, such as imputation.
- **Feature scaling and normalization:** Understand how and when to apply standardization and normalization to make numerical data within a particular range.
- **Encoding categorical data:** Gain knowledge on converting categorical data into a format that can be provided to ML models, such as one-hot encoding.

### Basic ML Libraries

- **Scikit-learn:** This library is fundamental for implementing machine learning algorithms. Understand the core concepts of model selection, training, and evaluation using Scikit-learn.
- **TensorFlow and PyTorch:** For those interested in diving deeper, gaining a basic understanding of these libraries can be beneficial for developing neural networks and deep learning models.

### 1. Vectoriation

Vectorization refers to the **_process of rewriting computations to operate on whole arrays (or matrices)_** rather than on individual elements, essentially performing operations on multiple data points simultaneously. Vectorized operations are typically much faster than their loop-based counterparts because they leverage low-level optimizations, such as SIMD (Single Instruction, Multiple Data) in CPUs and parallel execution on GPUs.

Example: Adding two vectors Consider two arrays (vectors) a and b of the same length. Instead of looping through each element to add them:

```
import numpy as np

a = np.array([1, 2, 3])
b = np.array([4, 5, 6])

# Vectorized addition
c = a + b  # Result: [5, 7, 9]
```

The entire array is added in a single operation, thanks to vectorization. This is much faster than manually iterating over elements in Python.

### 2. Broadcasting

Broadcasting is the ability to perform operations on arrays of different shapes and sizes by "stretching" or "duplicating" smaller arrays to match the dimensions of larger ones. This avoids explicitly reshaping arrays and is very useful in machine learning for performing operations on different-sized tensors.

Example: Adding a scalar to a vector

```
import numpy as np

a = np.array([1, 2, 3])
b = 2

# Broadcasting addition
c = a + b  # Result: [3, 4, 5]
```

Here, b is "broadcast" to match the shape of a as if it were [2, 2, 2], allowing element-wise addition.
